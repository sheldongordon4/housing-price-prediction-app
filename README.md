# Flask Deployment: Housing Prediction ML Model

## Project Overview

Housing Price Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application built with Flask. It predicts housing prices based on user inputs such as number of bedrooms, square footage, and year built. The project uses a linear regression model trained on simulated housing data and provides real-time predictions through a user-friendly web interface.

### Key Features:

- ML model trained with scikit-learn
- Model saved and loaded using Pickle
- Web interface created with Flask
- Inputs: bedrooms, square footage, house age
- Real-time price prediction

### Tech Stack:

Python, Flask, scikit-learn, HTML/CSS
### Data Sources

Simulated housing data: A dataset containing various attributes related to housing prices, including the number of bedrooms, square footage, year built, and price.

### Model Development and Training
The model was built using Python's scikit-learn linear regression model. The model was trained using the housing dataset and saved as a pickle file.

### Model Deployment

The model was deployed using Flask and a simple web interface was created to allow users to input housing attributes and receive pricing predictions.
